# Resource-Constrained Neural MCTS Oracle Synthesis

This directory implements a new logic-level line of work for:

> 面向资源约束量子布尔函数综合的神经蒙特卡洛树搜索方法

The method does not use SSHR parallelotope candidates.  It treats Boolean
oracle synthesis as a symbolic factorization search over ANF/XAG-style
compute/uncompute plans, then verifies the generated oracle circuits by
classical simulation.

Current presets:

- `smoke`: fast correctness/regression run.
- `pilot`: medium structured-oracle run with ANF, factor-MCTS, FPRM-MCTS,
  neural-MCTS, and SSHR-H references.
- `evidence_affine`: current paper-facing run.  It compares direct ANF,
  logical-AND direct ANF, fixed-coordinate logical-AND MCTS, affine-preconditioned
  neural MCTS, and SSHR-H on 322 Boolean functions.
- `ablation_affine`: same 322-function suite with affine-greedy and
  affine-no-guard variants added to isolate the neural refine and guard
  contributions.
- `traditional_small`: $n \leq 6$ comparison slice with direct ANF,
  logical-AND direct ANF, fixed-coordinate logical-AND MCTS, affine-preconditioned
  neural MCTS, ESOP cube beam, time-limited weighted ESOP MILP, and SSHR-H.
- `main`: large-scale placeholder for broader sweeps.

Outputs are written to `results/`.  The neural prior is saved at
`models/action_scorer_rollout_logical_and.pt`.

Current evidence from `results/analysis_evidence_affine.md`:

- 322 functions, 5 methods, 1610 result rows.
- `and_affine_nmcts` is correct on all 322 functions.
- Mean T-count reduction versus direct ANF: 61.83%.
- Mean T-count reduction versus logical-AND direct ANF: 40.12%.
- Versus fixed-coordinate logical-AND MCTS, `and_affine_nmcts` has 161 T-count
  wins, 160 ties, and 0 losses over the 321 completed baseline pairs; mean
  T-count reduction is 16.18%.
- Versus SSHR-H on supported functions, `and_affine_nmcts` has 171 wins, 5
  ties, and 1 loss in T-count; mean T-count reduction is 43.89%.
- One fixed-coordinate MCTS baseline row (`anf_n12_10`) timed out at 600 s.
  The affine method completed that same function within the experiment budget.

Ablation evidence from `results/analysis_ablation_affine.md`:

- `and_affine_greedy` alone already reduces mean T-count by 60.92% versus
  direct ANF, showing that affine coordinate search is the dominant source of
  improvement.
- `and_affine_no_guard` improves over `and_affine_greedy` in 65 score cases
  with 0 score losses, isolating the low-dimensional neural-refine benefit.
- `and_affine_nmcts` improves over `and_affine_no_guard` in 88 score cases
  with 0 score losses, isolating the fixed-coordinate MCTS guard benefit.
- `and_affine_nmcts` improves over `and_affine_greedy` in 153 score cases
  with 0 score losses.

Runtime/resource evidence from `results/runtime_ablation_affine.md`:

- affine-greedy completed all 322 functions with median runtime 0.033 s and
  max runtime 1.825 s.
- full `and_affine_nmcts` completed all 322 functions with median runtime
  0.609 s and max runtime 300.025 s.
- fixed-coordinate MCTS completed 321 functions and timed out once; its median
  runtime was 0.076 s and max completed runtime was 89.897 s.
- full `and_affine_nmcts` has the lowest all-suite mean T-count and composite
  score among the non-SSHR methods, while affine-greedy is the fastest strong
  setting.

Traditional Boolean/ESOP baseline evidence from
`results/analysis_traditional_small.md` and
`results/runtime_traditional_small.md`:

- 177 functions with $n \leq 6$, 7 methods, 1239 result rows, 0 errors, and 0
  skips.
- Mean T-count / composite score: `and_affine_nmcts` 45.88 / 55.37, fixed MCTS
  62.06 / 73.09, ESOP cube beam 71.32 / 83.82, ESOP MILP 83.55 / 96.67, and
  SSHR-H 81.04 / 88.19.
- Against ESOP cube beam, `and_affine_nmcts` has 171 T-count wins, 3 losses,
  and 3 ties, with a 34.61% mean T-count reduction and a 32.16% mean score
  reduction.
- Against time-limited weighted ESOP MILP, `and_affine_nmcts` has 162 T-count
  wins, 1 loss, and 14 ties, with a 29.45% mean T-count reduction and a
  26.88% mean score reduction.
- SSHR-H still has the lowest mean CNOT count on this small-function slice, so
  the claim remains low-T/resource-score synthesis rather than CNOT-only
  optimality.

Resource-profile stress-test evidence from
`results/analysis_resource_sweep.md`:

- 47 functions with $n \leq 6$, 4 resource profiles, 5 methods, 940 result
  rows, 0 errors, and 0 skips.
- `and_affine_nmcts` is the objective-score winner on 32/47 functions under
  T-heavy weights, 32/47 under balanced weights, 29/47 under CNOT-depth-heavy
  weights, and 30/47 under ancilla-tight weights.
- Against fixed-coordinate MCTS, `and_affine_nmcts` has score wins/losses/ties
  of 35/0/12, 35/0/12, 35/0/12, and 33/0/14 across the four profiles.
- The mean Affine-NMCTS resource vector changes only modestly across profiles
  (mean T 41.62--43.32; mean CNOT 84.89--86.43; mean depth 89.09--90.23).
  This supports robustness under resource profiles but also shows that the
  current candidate generator is not yet a strong Pareto-front optimizer.

Scope boundary: all costs are logical-level resource estimates.  The verifier
circuit is deterministic and classically checked, while the logical-AND cost
model accounts for low-T compute and Clifford/measurement-based uncompute.
No hardware mapping or connectivity constraints are included.
